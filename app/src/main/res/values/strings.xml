        I love to go to school. I learn so many new things at school every day.There are many different subjects I study at school.
        I study languages like Sanskrit, Hindi and English, and other subjects like mathematics, science and social studies.
        My school is very beautiful. There are nice, lush gardens with beautiful plants and trees.
        In spring time the blooming flowers are a spectacle. My school has a well equipped library, and I enjoy reading books.
        There are also computers in the school for our use.I love my school and my teachers. My teachers are very caring.
        They teach us with a great deal of patience, and they want us to become good and responsible human beings.
